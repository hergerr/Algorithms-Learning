# Algorithms-Learning

The project contains of 3 (possible 5) data structures:

- **Array (Table to avoid possible future collisions)**
- **Doubly linked list**
- **Heap**
- Binary Tree
- BST & Black-Red tree

All structures are going to be written in C++, in OOP way. 

There's also python script to generate random data for time test (I'm terrible in C++ and I write as little as possible in it)
